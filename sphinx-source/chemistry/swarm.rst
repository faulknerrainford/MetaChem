Swarm Chemistry
===============

Swarm Chemistry is a system built to explore artificial chemistry beyond the limited (S, R, A) format. Despite not
having a comfortable description in the (S, R, A) framework - it does not have direct interactions between particles -
Swarm Chemistry is widely known and accepted as an artifical chemistry. It is therefore important to show that, while
(S, R, A) may struggle with Swarm Chemistry it is comfortably described by MetaChem.

In this documentation we will start by describing the particles in the Swarm Chemistry followed by a description of the
graph that implements the Swarm Chemistry Algorithm. We will then provide descriptions of the swarm chemistry specific
nodes implemented for this chemistry. Finally we will provide the code used to generate the visualisations of Swarm Chemistry.
